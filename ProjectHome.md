## How can you use this project? ##
There are two ways:
  * For Windows users, you can download the binary distribution, unzip and run pyLTESimulator.exe.
  * For Linux-like users, and Python folks, you can download the source distribution, unzip and run .py scripts under various foder Simulation.

## What can this project do? ##
This project is an attempt to implement 3GPP 36.211 and 36.212 using Python, for study purpose. For LTE Uu time-resource visualization, please check out another project **[pyLTEVisualizer](http://code.google.com/p/pyltevisualizer/)**.

## If you find a bug. ##
This is very likely, and please, should you find a bug, please email me and my email is duo.ling.cn@gmail.com.

## A little history of this project ##
This project is used to be part of project [lte-phy-channel-on-air](http://code.google.com/p/lte-phy-channel-on-air/). As that project grew into a mixture of two targets with different nature, this project is split out.

## Dependencies ##
If you run from source code, except Python 2.7, you'll need two extra Python modules to do that:
  * MatPlotLib
  * NumPy
  * SciPy

## For code readers ##
This project is based on Python 2.7 and Python modules mentioned above. And it uses LEO to organize the code. If you never used it before, it is a literary programming tool, cool to use, and it's at http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html . It might have a steep learning curve at the beginning, but believe me, you'll love it. However, if you don't want to use LEO, I think you can just read .py files directly, but without LEO the source codes are quite messy.
